In order to feel more at peace with using Bootstrap layouts in the future, I decided to write a responsive dropdown navigation menu in pure CSS to make sure I really understood how it works.

I used a hacky way to make the animation slide effect by hiding the menu on the right side of the viewport and disable scroll x on the phone. It's just a roundabout way for the pure css challenge, using JavaScript would be much easier and quicker.

My main takeaway from this exercise was to become more proficient in using CSS Selectors, Transitions and layouts.
